			<p><b>The Artists:</b> Nick Scammell is fascinated by where the photograph meets the poem and where the image meets the object. His debut collection of poetry, London: Ghost Autopsy, was a Stride Magazine book of the year for 2009 and accompanied his first solo photographic exhibition of the same name. Nick curates and exhibits regularly with Crossing Lines, contributes to fLIP Magazine and was a part of the London Villages Project. He is presently working on an experimental book project - entitled Significant Wreckage - as well as a long-term project on London's independent second-hand bookshops, Archipelagoes. Studying for a photographic MA at LCC, Nick's practice orbits memory and failure via the everyday city.</p>
			
			<p>John Levett is a Visiting Research Fellow in the Centre for Urban & Community Research, Goldsmiths College. He is the convenor of the Crossing Lines Group, the organizer of the Greenwich Satellite Group of London Independent Photography and the organizer of The London Villages Project. His principal area of interest is that of Urban Spaces and Refractory Memory.</p>
