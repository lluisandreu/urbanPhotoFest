        <h1>Movement</h1>
        <p>The modern city is a space of movement, flux and flow. Everything changes;
        sometimes before our eyes, and sometimes almost imperceptibly over time.
        This inaugural exhibition of the Association of Urban Photographers, an
        international group of photographers and artists whose visual practices
        address the representation and evocation of contemporary city spaces,
        examines the notion of movement within and on the fringes of such spaces. </p>

        <p>Association members were asked to respond to the exhibition theme, and
        there was an expectation that the resulting images would be varied, diverse
        and have a quality of montage rather than a tight, linear flow. We thought that
        would be a good thing. Because urban photography brings with it so many
        ways of seeing and thinking about the urban domain, that to try to impose a
        visual over-view does not do justice to or reflect the range of practices at play
        within this ever-expanding field.</p>

        <p>All of the artists here are active urban visual researchers often involved in
        long-term projects, and these images invite viewers to reconsider how such a
        core urban theme might be approached from a multiplicity of perspectives. </p>
        <p>This exhibition is part of Urban Photo Fest in association with Goldsmiths,
        University of London and Tate Britain. </p>
