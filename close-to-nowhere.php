        <h3>Paul Halliday</h3>
        <p><strong>About the project</strong></p>
        <p>These images were made between 2002 and 2012 in response to a series of walking detours around cities and urban spaces such as Berlin, Shanghai, New York, Trieste, London, Paris, Las Vegas, Bogota, and Margate as a result of a number of unplanned and accidental encounters. The photographer’s main purpose was to use the camera to consider what it means to ‘not know a place’. Whilst walking through these spaces, he realized that there was something sociologically and philosophically unsettling about finding oneself in a city, urban or rural space that one had not anticipated being in, without any meaningful prior knowledge. As such, this caused a degree of disruption around notions of geographic certainty and place history. This in turn became an informal methodology by which ideas of ‘somewhere-ness’ and ‘nowhere-ness’ were revisited and rethought through an ongoing visual praxis that embraced the possibilities of being lost. </p>
