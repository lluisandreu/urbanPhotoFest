            <h2>Defining Urban Photography</h2>
            
            <p>Urban photography is an interdisciplinary field of visual practice concerned with the evocation and representation of urban spaces and the lives of those living, working and moving through such spaces. It takes many forms including architectural, landscape, portrait, street, object, performance, documentary, archaeological, design and fine-art photography; all attesting to the rich diversity of practices constituting an ongoing conversation about the nature of contemporary and historic visualisations of city spaces. As a field of intersecting practices, it is closely related to urban research and reflects many of the themes explored by sociologists, cultural theorists, artists, anthropologists, geographers, historians and writers concerned with the story of the city.
