        <h1>What is Urban Photography?</h1>
        <p>Urban photography is an interdisciplinary field of visual practice concerned
        with the evocation and representation of urban spaces and the lives of those
        living, working and moving through such spaces. It takes many forms
        including architectural, landscape, portrait, street, object, performance,
        documentary, archaeological, design and fine-art photography; all attesting to
        the rich diversity of practices constituting an ongoing conversation about the
        nature of contemporary and historic visualisations of city spaces. As a field of
        intersecting practices, it is closely related to urban research and reflects many
        of the themes explored by sociologists, cultural theorists, artists,
        anthropologists, geographers, historians and writers concerned with the story
        of the city.</p>
