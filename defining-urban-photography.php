            <h1>What is Urban Photography?</h1>

            <p>Urban photography is an interdisciplinary field of visual practice concerned
				with the evocation and representation of urban spaces and the lives of those
				living, working and moving through such spaces. It takes many forms
				including architectural, landscape, portrait, street, object, performance,
				documentary, archaeological, design and fine-art photography; all attesting to
				the rich diversity of practices constituting an ongoing conversation about the
				nature of contemporary and historic visualisations of city spaces. As a field of
				intersecting practices, it is closely related to urban research and reflects many
				of the themes explored by sociologists, cultural theorists, artists,
				anthropologists, geographers, historians and writers concerned with the story
				of the city.</p>
