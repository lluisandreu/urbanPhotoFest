            <h2>The Modern Language Experiment<br> at Urban Encounters</h2>
            
			<p>The Modern Language Experiment was established in 2007 by Matthew Stock and Keh Ng as an artist-led contemporary art project engaged in the development, discussion, contemplation and execution of the changing language of artistic production and through this process aims to enable new ways of spectatorship and engagement with contemporary art.</p>
			
			<p>For Urban Encounters we have collaborated with artist Leslie Deere where we will be focusing on the presence and absence of materiality in relation to image, cities, architecture and aesthesis. This will take the form of three radio broadcasts hosted on Resonance FM. Featuring discussions with Paul Halliday, Paul O'Kane, Celine Lunsford, Mark Jackson, John Driver, Mark Harris, Carmen Billows and Steven Ball.</p>

			<p>We are also pleased to have invited the following artists to create audio for our radio show playlists.
Carlos Noronha Fieo, Craig Cooper, Dorine Van Meel, Gordon Shrigley, Keh Ng, Matthew Stock, Maya Inbar, Mitra Saboury, Patrick Goddard, Robert Crosse, Sam Basu, and Warren Garland.</p>
