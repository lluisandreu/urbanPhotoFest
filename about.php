            <h2>About</h2>
            
            <p>Urban Photo Fest has evolved through a number of conversations, research initiatives and exhibitions involving a wide range of partners and contributors from the areas of visual arts, film and photography, education, urban research and the social sciences. Originally, the festival started out as a series of annual <em>Urban Encounters</em> symposia held at Tate Britain. Eventually, these symposia developed into a series of well-attended workshops, walks, exhibitions and portfolio reviews. People seemed to be enjoying these conversations, and noticeably, they kept coming back for more.</p>
            
            <p>Last year, we decided to bring the various <em>happenings</em> together within a highly focused and immersive ten-day period, as so many people were traveling in for the events, sometimes from considerable distances. Last year&rsquo;s inaugural festival proved very popular, with both Tate Britain (keynote, Victor Burgin) and British Library (keynote, Gillian Rose) symposia fully-booked (so if you plan to attend ticketed events, please book early). </p>
            
            <p>This year, we are offering an expanded programme including a photographic competition in association with the Royal Photographic Society (RPS), a master-class with international photographic artist Rut Blees Luxemburg, exhibitions with Photofusion, London Independent Photography and RPS, workshops, walks, interventions, and social events. Urban Photo Fest 2013 will focus on the concept of &lsquo;urban materialities&rsquo;, which is quite an ambiguous concept, and throughout the symposia and other festival events, we hope that a number of lively and stimulating encounters will take place around this theme.</p>
            
            <p>So what&rsquo;s this festival about and who&rsquo;s it for? In short, it is an interdisciplinary space engaging with a variety of visual, theoretical and research practices, and it will be of interest to anyone with a desire to explore how the city might be thought of and viewed through multiple lenses - real, imagined and metaphorical.</p>
