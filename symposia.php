	            <h2>Urban Encounters:<br>Urban Materialities Symposium</h2>
	            
	            <p>Focusing on the theme of Urban Materialities, this year’s Urban Encounters symposium will highlight practices from a range of disciplines - including architecture, archaelogy, visual arts and geography - that engage with notions of thing-ness. The interdisciplinary contributions bring distinctive, yet overlapping concerns to the investigation, critical analysis and theorizing of materialities within the urban context. These can include geographies of security and surveillance, bodies, surfaces, everyday objects, or larger architectural forms.</p>
	 
	            <p>Panels engage with these concepts and practices through the themes of Sensibilities, Objecthood, and Disappearances. </p>
	            
	            <p>Speakers are <b>Peter Fraser</b> ‘A City in the Mind’, <b>Adrian Lahoud</b>, <b>Corinne Silva</b> ‘Gardening the Suburbs: the Politics of Planting in Israel/Palestine’, <b>Paola Yacoub</b> ‘Under this Trail there are Corpses’, <b>Tatiana Macedo</b>, <b>Paul Goodwin</b>, <b>Cristoph Lueder</b> ‘Upside Down and Sideways Up – Corporeality in Translations between Ground and Image Plane’, <b>Nick Ferguson</b> ‘Self-centred Objects: Suburbia, Intervention and Photographic Representation’, <b>Dan Hays</b> ‘Touch Screen (screen as landscape)’, <b>Isaac Marrero-Guillamón</b> ‘Contesting the Tyranny of Redevelopment: Critical Art and the London Olympics’, <b>Paul Halliday</b>, <b>Rachel Jones</b> ‘Landscape of Disappearances’ and <b>Caroline Knowles</b>.</p>	            
	            
	            <p>This symposium is organised in collaboration with the Centre for Urban and Community Research at Goldsmiths, University of London and Kingston University’s Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture.</p>

				<h2>Visual Urbanism:<br>Perceptions of the Material Landscape</h2>
				
				<p>How do material aspects of the urban landscape inform and inspire urban research? How can visual research methods enable urban researchers to investigate the city’s immaterialities? How do images shape the way we view the material form of the city? Following the success of last year’s event, researchers and practitioners from across the humanities and social sciences will come together to discuss contemporary concerns within visual urbanism in the second annual conference of the International Association of Visual Urbanists. An emphasis will be placed on innovative methods within current urban research relating to the arts, humanities and social sciences.</p>
	 
				<p>The conference will comprise presentations and panel discussions examining interdisciplinary approaches to investigating the materiality of the urban landscape. A keynote talk will be given by Professor Caroline Knowles (Goldsmiths, University of London). The event will include a short film festival showcasing work by artists and researchers exploring the urban landscape through moving images.</p>
				
				<p>Refreshments, a sandwich lunch and wine reception are included in the ticket price.</p>
