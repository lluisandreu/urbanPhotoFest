	            <h2>Lo-Fi Photography</h2>
	            
				<p><b>The Tutors: </b>Jay started her photographic life in the darkroom, and has never lost the fascination of watching an image slowly emerge from the developing soup. Once the wonderful world of a stuffy, poorly lit and smelly room became a reality, experimenting with lith printing, toning and alternative techniques were added to the list of things to play with. Sadly, with other pressures and priorities, the darkroom is now used for alternative work only – but a return to conventional printing is not ruled out. Jay is a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society, Chairman of the Visual Art Group of the RPS, and a member of the London Salon. She is a member of Richmond and Twickenham Photographic Society and exhibits with Spectrum PhotoArt, a group of six photographers from the South East.</p>
				
				<p>Del Barrett ARPS is a free-lance writer and lecturer, who is Chair of both the RPS Documentary & Visual Journalism Group and of the London region. Del is a regular contributor to Advanced Photography magazine. Her photography can be broadly described as contemporary urban documentary, covering a range of topics from Hyper-Reality in the High Street to Streetology on the Banks of the Danube.</p>
				 
				<p><b>The Workshop:</b> Discover the joys of lo-fi photography at this workshop, led by Jay Charnock FRPS and Del Barrett ARPS. The day will begin with an introduction to lo-fi photography, where participants will be given hints and tips on what to look for and how to produce effective lo-fi images. This will be followed by a mentored urban walk (1.5 miles), where participants will have the chance to try out a variety of equipment. The day will finish with a review of images taken during the walk.</p>
				
				<p><b>Needed:</b> Equipment details will be sent to participants with confirmation emails. <br/><br/>Please note: Film and processing costs are not included.</p>

				<h2>Typology and the Beautiful Nothing</h2>
	            
				<p><b>The Tutor:</b> While studying architecture in Canada, Karl Grupe started using photography to document projects, fell in love with the medium and never looked back. Since then he has worn many hats within the industry, which include editor, talent scout, researcher, lecturer, curator, writer and photographer. He is an Associate Lecturer at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and an MRes Design student at Goldsmiths College where he is researching smartphone photography by non-professionals as a developing vernacular within brand campaigns.

				<p><b>The Workshop:</b> Led by Karl Grupe, this workshop will explore the method of communicating through the use of typology. Participants will be introduced to the abstract of typology, from its origins to contemporary use in photography and be given examples of how it is used effectively by image makers as a visual communication device. Participants will then have the opportunity to approach the urban environment through the typological lens in a practical photographic exercise designed to shift the way photographers "see" and perform under this context. </p>
				
				<p><b>Needed:</b> Camera, memory cards/film, spare batteries, warm, comfortable clothing, sensible footwear.<br/><br/>Please note: Film and processing costs are not included.</p>

				<h2>The Abstract Beach</h2>
	            
				<p><b>The Tutor:</b> Ida Pap is a self-taught photographer living in East London. Growing up in central Budapest she has an odd sympathy for urban decay and loves the abandoned feeling of the city. She believes in seeing beyond the average to capture those details people are too busy to pay attention to, using often unseen treasures as main subjects. The people in her photography are secondary and mostly coincidental, thus she doesn’t concentrate on documenting people in their environments but the environment itself. Her body of urban work includes urban abstract, architectural, conceptual and street portraits. Please visit <a href="http://www.ideoda.com" target="_blank">www.ideoda.com</a> for examples of her work. </p>
				 
				<p><b>The Workshop:</b> Led by urban photographer Ida Pap, this workshop around the banks of the Thames, will enable participants to learn some of Ida’s secrets for seeing things in our urban environment in a different way and have the chance to shoot some "urbanalia". After the shoot, Ida will offer critique and feedback on participants' images.</p>
				
				<p><b>Needed:</b> Camera, memory cards/film, spare batteries, warm, comfortable clothing, sensible footwear<br/><br/>Please note: Film and processing costs are not included.</p>

				<h2>Retrospeculations: <br>Reconstructing a Past to Come </h2>
	            
				<p><b>The Discussants</b> Nick Scammell is fascinated by where the photograph meets the poem and where the image meets the object. His debut collection of poetry, London: Ghost Autopsy, was a Stride Magazine book of the year for 2009 and accompanied his first solo photographic exhibition of the same name. Nick curates and exhibits regularly with Crossing Lines, contributes to fLIP Magazine and was a part of the London Villages Project. He is presently working on an experimental book project - entitled Significant Wreckage - as well as a long-term project on London's independent second-hand bookshops, Archipelagoes. Studying for a photographic MA at LCC, Nick's practice orbits memory and failure via the everyday city.</p>
				 
				<p>John Levett is a Visiting Research Fellow in the Centre for Urban & Community Research, Goldsmiths College. He is the convenor of both the Crossing Lines Group and the Greenwich Group of London Independent Photography and organizer of The London Villages Project.</p>
				
				<p><b>The Seminar:</b> <em>How can a relationship with the past exist in which memory functions as an archive process, allowing continual reconsideration, rather than as a form of entombment?</em> Renée Green</p>
				
				<p>A gathering of gatherings made over twenty years; an unfolding; a condensation (Freud) of tremendous fragments (Klee) - in this work, John Levett will respond to Green's question by way of Blanchot's proposal of a past to come, and in that spirit re-engineer, re-purpose and re-imagine his archive.</p>
				
				<p>Mutations of connection and disconnection (Foster) are hoped for: new lines of interpretation, counter-archives within the archive. Gaps and absences will be taken as forms of evidence (Merewether) for this new prospective past (Demos) and the freedoms it may offer.</p>
				
				<p>A presentation will be given by both artist and curator; exploring the tensions between the following statements:</p>
	
				<p><em>The archive always works against itself.</em> Derrida</p>
	
				<p><em>Memory restores possibility to the past.</em> Dimsdale</p>

				<h2>A Two Way Street:<br>Theory into Practice, Practice into Theory</h2>
	            
				<p><b>The Discussants:</b> Hugh Look is Chair of London Independent Photography and founded LIP's Central London Group. His interest in the relationship between theory and practice in photography was stimulated by attending the Crossing Lines group and in conversation with other photographers, many of them members of LIP.</p>
				 
				<p>John Levett is a Visiting Research Fellow in the Centre for Urban & Community Research, Goldsmiths College. He is the convenor of both the Crossing Lines Group and the Greenwich Group of London Independent Photography and organizer of The London Villages Project.</p>
				
				<p><b>The Seminar:</b> This event is designed to stimulate and enlighten practising photographers about the value of theory to their practice, and to show that theory also evolves in response to the changing practice and (importantly) role of photography in societies, politics, the gallery; on screen and on the page. ‘Theory’ can seem distant and detached from the making of actual photographs but many have found that theory can both stimulate their work and invigorate their imagination.</p>
				
				<p>We aim to explore the value of theory to photographers working within the urban sphere: theories of perception and ‘seeing’; the role of photography, anthropology and ethnography; socio-political thinking; communications and aesthetics.</p>
				
				<p>The session will consist of four presentations by practicing photographers whose work is both informed and sustained by an appreciation of ‘theory’ as it relates to their practice within the urban sphere. Open discussion will follow. Hugh Look & John Levett will chair the session & the panel will consist of: Professor Christopher Wainwright, Claire Levy, Judith Jones, Michael Rodgers.</p>
