    <h1>Urban Photo Fest 2013</h1>
    <p>In 2013 we offered an expanded programme that included a photographic
    competition in association with the Royal Photographic Society (RPS), a
    masterclass with international photographic artist Rut Blees Luxemburg,
    exhibitions with Photofusion, London Independent Photography and RPS,
    workshops, walks, interventions, and social events. Urban Photo Fest 2013
    focused on the theme of ‘urban materialities’, which is quite an ambiguous
    concept, and throughout the symposia and other festival events, a number of
    lively and stimulating encounters took place around this topic.</p>
