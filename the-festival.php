        <h2>The Festival</h2>
        <p>Urban Photo Fest has evolved through a number of conversations, research
        initiatives and exhibitions involving a wide range of partners and contributors
        from the areas of visual arts, film and photography, education, urban research
        and the social sciences. Originally, the festival started out as a series of
        annual <em>Urban Encounters</em> symposia held at Tate Britain. Eventually, these
        symposia developed into a series of well-attended workshops, walks,
        exhibitions and portfolio reviews. People seemed to be enjoying these
        conversations, and noticeably, they kept coming back for more. </p>
        <p>This year, we’ve decided to offer a five day festival, collaborating with Tate
        Britain, Photofusion, Goldsmiths, Kingston and Oxford Universities,
        Association of Urban Photographers, London Independent Photography,
        Openvizor, International Urban Photography Summer School, Menier, Silver
        Print and Greenwich Galleries. We have also programmed a masterclass with
        the internationally renowned photographer, Peter Marlow from Magnum
        Photos, focusing on movement within and beyond the city. Urban Photo Fest
        is also pleased to welcome Anne Zeitz as festival artist, in addition to
        participating in the Tate conference, Anne will be developing a workshop and
        exhibition for next year’s festival. </p>
        <p>In addition to the main conference at Tate Britain, we are offering a series of
        walks on the conference weekend Sunday, where participants will be
        encouraged to think about and experience movement and flow through a
        variety of urban spaces. And of course, there are the exhibitions with <em>Habitus</em>
        (graduates from the International MA in Photography and Urban Cultures at
        Goldsmiths, University of London) at the Menier Gallery, <em>Movement</em>
        (Association of Urban Photographers) at the Silver Print Gallery, and <em>Close to
        Nowhere</em> (a selection of images from a ten year project focusing on global
        cities) at the Greenwich Gallery. </p>
        <p>Which brings us to this year’s festival theme of <em>Movement</em>, <em>Mobilities and
        Migrations</em>. These words mean different things to urbanists, photographers
        and artists; and that is what we want to encourage people to explore
        throughout the festival events. Hopefully, people will also take this opportunity
        to experience their own collective and private migrations around London over
        the five days, to attend the conference, workshop and seminar; go on walks,
        visit exhibitions and book onto the masterclass. Most importantly, the festival
        encourages debate about the nature of contemporary photography, and the
        possibility to network with others interested in this increasingly vital area of
        visual and urban practice. </p>
