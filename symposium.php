				<p>This year’s Urban Encounters symposium looks at the visual manifestations 
					and effects of movement, mobility and migration on the historic and 
					contemporary city. Over two days, an international line up of artists, 
					academics, and researchers reflect on the nature of flow and flux through and 
					between city spaces with a variety of topics including economic mobility, 
					labour movements, borders, and the migration of things and people. </p>

				<p>In addition to a series of panels and presentations, this year’s symposium 
					features half a day of workshops, seminars and walks, led by speakers and 
					organisers. Participants will be contacted closer to the event to select from 
					these activities. </p>

				<p>The series of panels focuses on the experiences of people and communities, 
					built and architectural environments, urban landscapes, performativity and 
					how material cultures reflect the possibilities and challenges that redefine how 
					we understand the changing faces of everyday urban life. The workshops, 
					seminars and walks provide a more intimate context through which to directly 
					explore and discuss the ideas and themes of the symposium. </p>

				<p>This symposium is of particular interest to photographers, artists, film-makers, 
					architects, sociologists, geographers and social researchers whose work 
					addresses notions of social change and the decentring of urban life within an 
					age of expanding globalisation and changing geographic boundaries. 
					Participants include Bradley Garrett, Paul Halliday, Jennifer Bajorek, Paul 
					Goodwin, Adam Kaasa, Xavier Ribas, Lia Chavez, David Kendall, Charlotte 
					Cullinan and Jeanine Richards, Anne Zeitz, Adel Tincelin, Lorenzo Bernini, 
					Ben Gidley, Tom Morton, Caroline Knowles, as well as a keynote address on 
					Friday by internationally renowned photographer, artist and director Nadav 
					Kander. </p>

				<p><em>Urban Encounters is organised in partnership with the Centre for Urban and 
					Community Research (CUCR), Goldsmiths, University of London; Kingston 
					University, Oxford University and Openvizor. </em></p>
