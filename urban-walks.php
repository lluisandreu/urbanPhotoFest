	            <h2>Erection, edifice and eccentricity:<br/> an eclectic's tour of Chelsea</h2>
            
			<p><b>The Tutor:</b> Del Barrett ARPS is a free-lance writer and lecturer, who is Chair of both the RPS Documentary & Visual Journalism Group and of the London region. Del is a regular contributor to Advanced Photography magazine. Her photography can be broadly described as contemporary urban documentary, covering a range of topics from Hyper-Reality in the High Street to Streetology on the Banks of the Danube. Having lived in Chelsea for 25 years, the area is one of her favourite photographic locations.</p>
			 
			<p><b>The Walk:</b> Old Chelsea has been home to many artists and eccentric denizens over the years, as well as fictional characters including James Bond and George Smiley. The streets are bursting with eclectic mixes of architecture and idiosyncracy, not to mention blue plaques - Cheyne Walk allegedly has more blue plaques than any other street in the UK. With the help of anecdotes, local trivia and snippets of history, this guided walk will offer participants the chance to capture the unusual and the bizarre in the streets of Old Chelsea.</p>
			
			<p>Two optional <b>assignments</b> will be offered:</p>
			 
			<p>1. <em>Where did they live?</em><br>Armed with a set of clues, participants will be challenged to find and shoot the buildings where the famous and infamous once resided. There will be a small prize for the image that in the opinion of the judges is the most creative and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
			
			<p>2. <em>Furniture</em><br>Old Chelsea offers a wealth of architectural detail and street furniture – from the Victorian tiles of the Michelin Building to the assortment of drainhole covers in the back streets. Participants will be asked to produce a “Collection of Detail”. All participants will have the chance to exhibit their work in the RPS London Space (The Cave in Greenwich).</p>

			
			<p><b>Needed:</b> Camera, memory cards/film, spare batteries, warm, comfortable clothing, sensible footwear. Tripod would be useful.</p>

			<h2>Urban Edge</h2>
			
			<p><b>The Tutor:</b> Peter Coles is a photographer and freelancer journalist, writer and editor. A Visiting Fellow in CUCR (Goldsmiths) since 2007 he is a regular tutor on the MA in Photography and Urban Cultures and the International Photography Summer School. Interested in abandoned and found objects in urban streets, Peter's work also focuses on the meetings between urban and rural, the built environment and plant and animal life, especially the way that traces of former developments and land use can be seen in contemporary urban geography. <a href="http://www.petercoles.net/" target="_blank" />www.petercoles.net</a></p>
			 
			<p><b>The Walk:</b> The walk follows the Greenway, a raised footpath tracing a waste water outfall, from Stratford in east London, to the Thames at Woolwich. The walk passes through varying landscapes, with allotments, a cemetery, mudflats, parks and housing, becoming increasingly industrial, with disused gasworks, docks and factories by the river. The main challenge is to record the ways in which "nature" and "urban" meet, whether harmoniously, or in conflict.</p>
			
			<p><b>Needed:</b> walking shoes / <b>Optional</b>: camera, notebook, binoculars, video camera, or sound recording equipment.</p>

			<p><b>The Walk:</b> Think about a city. Think about pleasure gardens and dance clubs and guys in steam rooms. Think about secret agents and expensive tower blocks and goats and pigs and ponies. Think about art and politicians, about lords and MPs and a sovereign. Think about churches and palaces and council flats. Think about monuments and bells and gigantic wheels and fish in tanks and paintings. Think about violins and pianos and actors and buskers and opera singers. Think about oysters and hot dogs and juices and chips and paella and pizza and beer and noodles and champagne. Think about multinationals and bookstalls. Think about migrants and tourists. Think about prostitutes and drug dealers. Think about currency and trainers and uniforms and black ties and Chinese remedies and sex toys and porn. Think about massage and alcohol and ice cream and cannabis and coffee. Think about trains and buses and cars and boats and ships and scooters. Think about roads and pavements and soil and tracks and bridges. Think about eating and drinking and smoking and standing and sitting and lying and walking and jogging and skating and cycling and queuing and waiting and shopping and watching and listening and smelling and photographing. Think about the air and the earth and the water. Think about people. And now think about you…</p>

			<h2>CITY EAST:<br> liminal, not peripheral: a walk</h2>
			
			<p><b>The Tutor:</b> Peter Luck is a retired architect, presently a photographer and researcher into aspects of London history, particularly relating to industry and the Thames. He is a member of LIP, of the Crossing Lines group, the Port of London Study Group and of a foreshore recording and observation group in the Thames Discovery Programme.</p>
			
			<p><b>The Walk:</b> An area from Mark Lane in the west to Back Church Lane in the east changes its apparent character along its course: unquestionably City in the west, unquestionably Inner London in the east with no clear delineation between the two. No certainty either which, administratively or culturally, one is in whilst traversing the middle zones.</p>
			<p>The area was closely associated with the down-river docks. East India Company warehouses stood until mid nineteenth century when demolition began for Fenchurch Street station and Lloyds Avenue development. Railway company warehouses grew beyond the city. Sugar-boilers departed. In 1885 the Cooperative Wholesale Society established its London headquarters on Leman Street. Bank office and computer complexes have replaced warehousing and are being replaced by up-market housing.</p>
			<p>We begin in the City at Fenchurch Street station and wind eastwards through layers of urban history and present development, returning to Tower Gateway.</p>
			
			<p><b>Needed:</b> Camera and comfortable shoes</p>
