			<h1>Urban Walks</h1>
			<h3>Cruising Hackney: Capturing the culture of London’s gentrification</h3>
			<p><strong>The Tutor:</strong> Juliet Kahne is a writer, researcher and photographer from Los Angeles. She
			recently obtained her PhD in urban/cultural geography from King’s College London, and most
			of her past work has focused on gentrification and the changing cultural landscape of urban
			neighbourhoods and city centres. With an interest in all aspects of urban culture – from
			architecture to fashion, live performance to abstract urban blogging – she seeks to bring the
			nooks and crannies of urban living to a wider audience through an array of visual mediums,
			and her photography is an attempt to reflect an intersection between the urban, the political,
			and the comical.</p>
			<p><strong>The Walk:</strong> From the bustling shopping-scapes of Hoxton, to the middle-class colonization
			taking place between Dalston and Stoke Newington, this walk will observe, investigate, and
			question varying stages of gentrification by identifying visual markers of the process in
			Hackney’s urban landscape. Within this street photographer’s paradise, various stages of
			gentrification are presented in an array of forms –from Kebab shops to artisan coffee shops,
			from bric-a-brac to farmers markets, from dilapidated buildings to historic renovations – there
			is plenty of room for interpretation, investigation, and representation. The walk will enhance
			one’s understanding of the gentrification process and how it consumes spaces in the city with
			a range of outcomes. Economic, social, and cultural change is evident and constantly
			changing throughout the areas we will explore, and there will be endless opportunities to
			capture this process through the lens. </p>
			<p><strong>Needed:</strong> A camera and comfortable shoes for walking. </p>

			<h3>London’s Olympic Park</h3>
			<p><strong>The Tutor:</strong> Anthony Palmer has been photographing the Olympic Park landscape for six
			years and was previously the Filming and Photography Manager for the Olympic Delivery
			Authority. </p>
			<p><strong>The Walk:</strong> London’s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park re-opened after the 2012 Games in two
			stages, firstly July 2013 and then April 2014, and is now a large public park similar in size to
			Hyde Park. For those unfamiliar with the changes, this Olympic Park walk is an opportunity to
			see how the Park is re-establishing itself, how it is being used and how it connects up to
			places that have remained peripheral to it for the last six years of construction works. </p>
			<p>Within the Park we will be able to see the legacy venues of the Velo Park and Aquatics Centre
			that are now in use and how the Olympic Village is becoming the new residential
			neighborhood of East Village. We will look at the different ways in which the landscaping has
			produced a sustainable, naturalistic habitat in the north Park, while in the south Park there
			are the themed 2012 Gardens and Great British Garden to see. As we go there will be
			opportunities to look at the context of the wider Stratford City and The International Quarter
			regenerations as well as discuss how residential redevelopment is affecting existing
			communities that now border the Park. </p>
			<p><strong>Needed:</strong> A camera and comfortable shoes for walking.</p>

			<h3>Brighton</h3>
			<p><strong>The Tutor:</strong> Gill Golding is an urban landscape photographer whose method of engaging with
			the urban environment is to walk. She has lived in Brighton &amp; Hove for 20 years and has
			enjoyed discovering several histories of the city, and through her walking, has observed and
			experienced changes to numerous neighbourhoods. Gill is currently pursuing an MA in
			Photography and Urban Cultures at Goldsmiths University.</p>
			<p><strong>The Walk:</strong> When we think of Brighton, we tend to think about the sea, the pier, the Pavilion
			and the Regency architecture, but there is another side of Brighton to explore also. Brighton
			&amp; Hove became a city in 2000, and beneath the facades of the different neighbourhoods are
			stories of poverty, wealth, loss of industry, gentrification and urban renewal. From the
			beginnings of a small fishing town to the vibrant city that exists today, each era has brought
			with it a new story, layered on top of the old one. Come and discover how our culture of
			independent shops emerged; see some examples of the bungaroosh used in some of our
			architecture; walk down a twitten or two with me.</p>
			<p>Our walk begins at the station where, over a cup of coffee, a potted history of the area is
			provided. We will walk through London Road, the North Laine, The Lanes and Kemptown,
			walking back along the seafront as the light is fading and, if there are clear skies, the sun will
			be setting. There will be a brief lunch break which, depending on the weather, will be by the
			sea or in a local cafe. </p>
			<p><strong>What you will need:</strong> Comfortable shoes and any type of camera (yes, a phone camera will be fine!) – and if you would prefer, a packed lunch</p>
