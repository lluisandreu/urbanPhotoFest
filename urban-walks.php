	        <h1>Urban Walks</h1>
	        
	        <h3>Cruising Hackney: Capturing the culture of London’s gentrification</h3>
            
	        <p>The Tutor: Juliet Kahne is a writer, researcher and photographer from Los Angeles. She 
				recently obtained her PhD in urban/cultural geography from King’s College London, and most 
				of her past work has focused on gentrification and the changing cultural landscape of urban 
				neighbourhoods and city centres. With an interest in all aspects of urban culture – from 
				architecture to fashion, live performance to abstract urban blogging – she seeks to bring the 
				nooks and crannies of urban living to a wider audience through an array of visual mediums, 
				and her photography is an attempt to reflect an intersection between the urban, the political, 
				and the comical.</p>

			<p>The Walk: From the bustling shopping-scapes of Hoxton, to the middle-class colonization 
				taking place between Dalston and Stoke Newington, this walk will observe, investigate, and 
				question varying stages of gentrification by identifying visual markers of the process in 
				Hackney’s urban landscape. Within this street photographer’s paradise, various stages of 
				gentrification are presented in an array of forms –from Kebab shops to artisan coffee shops, 
				from bric-a-brac to farmers markets, from dilapidated buildings to historic renovations – there 
				is plenty of room for interpretation, investigation, and representation. The walk will enhance 
				one’s understanding of the gentrification process and how it consumes spaces in the city with 
				a range of outcomes. Economic, social, and cultural change is evident and constantly 
				changing throughout the areas we will explore, and there will be endless opportunities to 
				capture this process through the lens. </p>

			<p><strong>Needed:</strong> A camera and comfortable shoes for walking. </p>

			<h3>London’s Olympic Park</h3>
			
			<p>The Tutor: Anthony Palmer has been photographing the Olympic Park landscape for six 
				years and was previously the Filming and Photography Manager for the Olympic Delivery 
				Authority. </p>

			<p>The Walk: London’s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park re-opened after the 2012 Games in two 
				stages, firstly July 2013 and then April 2014, and is now a large public park similar in size to 
				Hyde Park. For those unfamiliar with the changes, this Olympic Park walk is an opportunity to 
				see how the Park is re-establishing itself, how it is being used and how it connects up to 
				places that have remained peripheral to it for the last six years of construction works. </p>

			<p>Within the Park we will be able to see the legacy venues of the Velo Park and Aquatics Centre 
				that are now in use and how the Olympic Village is becoming the new residential 
				neighborhood of East Village. We will look at the different ways in which the landscaping has 
				produced a sustainable, naturalistic habitat in the north Park, while in the south Park there 
				are the themed 2012 Gardens and Great British Garden to see. As we go there will be 
				opportunities to look at the context of the wider Stratford City and The International Quarter 
				regenerations as well as discuss how residential redevelopment is affecting existing 
				communities that now border the Park. </p>

			<h3>Brighton</h3>
			
			<p>The Tutor: Gill Golding is an urban landscape photographer whose method of engaging with 
				the urban environment is to walk. She has lived in Brighton &amp; Hove for 20 years and has 
				enjoyed discovering several histories of the city, and through her walking, has observed and 
				experienced changes to numerous neighbourhoods. Gill is currently pursuing an MA in 
				Photography and Urban Cultures at Goldsmiths University.</p>

			<p>The Walk: When we think of Brighton, we tend to think about the sea, the pier, the Pavilion 
				and the Regency architecture, but there is another side of Brighton to explore also. Brighton 
				&amp; Hove became a city in 2000, and beneath the facades of the different neighbourhoods are 
				stories of poverty, wealth, loss of industry, gentrification and urban renewal. From the 
				beginnings of a small fishing town to the vibrant city that exists today, each era has brought 
				with it a new story, layered on top of the old one. Come and discover how our culture of 
				independent shops emerged; see some examples of the bungaroosh used in some of our 
				architecture; walk down a twitten or two with me.</p>

			<p>Our walk begins at the station where, over a cup of coffee, a potted history of the area is 
				provided. We will walk through London Road, the North Laine, The Lanes and Kemptown, 
				walking back along the seafront as the light is fading and, if there are clear skies, the sun will 
				be setting. There will be a brief lunch break which, depending on the weather, will be by the 
				sea or in a local cafe. </p>


			<p><strong>What you will need:</strong> Comfortable shoes and any type of camera (yes, a phone camera will be fine!) – and if you would prefer, a packed lunch</p>
