            <p>Focusing on the theme of Urban Materialities, this year&rsquo;s Urban Encounters symposium will highlight practices from a range of disciplines - including architecture, archeology, visual arts and geography - that engage with notions of thing-ness. The interdisciplinary contributions bring distinctive, yet overlapping concerns to the investigation, critical analysis and theorizing of materialities witihin the urban context. These can include geographies of security and surveillance, bodies, surfaces, everyday objects, or larger architectural forms.</p>
              
            <p>Speakers will engage with these concepts and practices through the following themed panels: Forensics, Objecthood, and Disappearances. A full list of speakers will be confirmed shortly.</p>

              Wednesday, 9th October 2013 <br>
              6.30 - 8.30pm<br>
              Venue: Goldsmiths, University of London [room details]<br>
              Cost: Free but with booking <br>

            <p>A gathering of gatherings made over twenty years; an unfolding; a condensation (Freud) of tremendous fragments (Klee) - in this work, John Levett will respond to Green's question by way of Blanchot's proposal of a past to come, and in that spirit re-engineer, re-purpose and re-imagine his archive.  Mutations of connection and disconnection (Foster) are hoped for: new lines of interpretation, counter-archives within the archive. Gaps and absences will be taken as forms of evidence (Merewether) for this new prospective past (Demos) and the freedoms it may offer.</p>
            
            <p>A presentation will be given by both artist and curator; exploring the tensions between the following statements: &lsquo;<em>The archive always works against itself&rsquo; (</em>Derrida), and<em> &lsquo;Memory restores possibility to the past&rsquo; (</em>Dimsdale).</p>

Nick curates and exhibits regularly with Crossing Lines, contributes to fLIP Magazine and was a part of the London Villages Project.

            <p class="event"><strong>A Two Way Street: Theory into Practice, Practice into Theory </strong><br>
              Friday, 11th October 2013 <br>
              6.30 - 8.30pm [confirm]<br>
              Venue: Goldsmiths, University of London [room details]<br>
              Cost: Free but with booking <br>
              Information and booking: [web details]</p>
              
            <p>This event is designed to stimulate and enlighten practising photographers about the value of theory to their practice, and to show that theory also evolves in response to the changing practice and (importantly) role of photography in societies, politics, the gallery; on screen and on the page. &lsquo;Theory&rsquo; can seem distant and detached from the making of actual photographs but many have found that theory can both stimulate their work and invigorate their imagination.</p>
            
            <p>We aim to explore the value of theory to photographers working within the urban sphere: theories of perception and &lsquo;seeing&rsquo; the role of photography, anthropology and ethnography; socio-political thinking; communications and aesthetics.</p>
            
            <p>The session will consist of four presentations by practicing photographers whose work is both informed and sustained by an appreciation of &lsquo;theory&rsquo; as it relates to their practice within the urban sphere. Open discussion will follow.</p>

            <p>Led by Karl Grupe, this workshop will explore the method of communicating through the use of typology.  Participants will be introduced to the abstract of typology, from its origins to contemporary use in photography and be given examples of how it is used effectively by image makers as a visual communication device. Participants will then have the opportunity to approach the urban environment through the typological lens in a practical photographic exercise designed to shift the way photographers &quot;see&quot; and perform under this context. <br>
            
              <strong>About the tutor:</strong>  While studying architecture in Canada Karl Grupe started using photography to document projects, fell in love with the medium and never looked back. Since then he&nbsp;has worn many hats within the industry which include editor, talent scout, researcher, lecturer, curator, writer and photographer. He is an Associate Lecturer at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and an MRes Design student at Goldsmiths College where he is researching smartphone photography by non-professionals as a developing vernacular within brand campaigns. &nbsp;Web: karlgrupe.com/blog Instagram:stuffcarlsees<br>

              Friday 11th October<br>
              10.00am – 6.00pm <br>
              Tutor: Ida Pap<br>

            <p>Led by urban photographer Ida Pap, this workshop around the banks of the Thames, will  enable participants to learn some of Ida&rsquo;s secrets for seeing things in our urban environment in a different way and have the chance to shoot some &quot;urbanalia&quot;.  After the shoot, Ida will offer critique and feedback on participants' images. <br>
              
            <p><strong>About the tutor:</strong> Ida Pap is a self-taught photographer living in East London. Growing up in central Budapest she has an odd sympathy for urban decay and loves the abandoned feeling of the city. She believes in seeing beyond the average to capture those details people are too busy to pay attention to,&nbsp;using often unseen treasures as main subjects. The people in her photography are secondary and mostly coincidental, thus she doesn&rsquo;t concentrate on documenting people in their environments but the environment itself. Her body of urban work includes urban abstract, architectural, conceptual and street portraits. Please visit <a href="http://www.ideoda.com/">www.ideoda.com</a> for examples of her work. <br>
