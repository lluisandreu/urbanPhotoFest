        <h1>Habitus</h1>
        <p>Habitus is a photography exhibition showcasing the work of a number of
        MA Photography and Urban Cultures students from Goldsmiths,
        University of London. The exhibition is also part of the Urban Photo Fest
        2014. The approach and focus of the research varies from in depth
        exploration of familial histories to the impact of major regeneration
        projects. It includes subculture studies to techno-waste in Ghana, visual
        contrast in the city to the fringes of tactile perception and memory. Yet
        as urban sociologists, the group is brought together by an undying
        interest in the narratives that underlie the city and our existence in it.
        The artists adopt multidisciplinary attitudes in their works and draw
        influences from art practice, philosophy, journalism, sociology,
        geography and architecture. They bring a diverse point of view and
        critical eye, through their discovery of everyday life within the urban
        realm. Through the connection of theory, practice and discussion the
        participants have engaged in core themes of urban cultures. This
        exhibition is a visual manifestation of collective dialogue. </p>
