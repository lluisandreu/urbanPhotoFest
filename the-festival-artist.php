            <h2>The Festival Artist</h2>

			<p><strong>Anne Zeitz</strong> is a researcher and artist working with photography, video and sound media.</p>

			<p><strong>About</strong><em>Retention</em></p>

			<p>Retention, her last work made with David Boureau, deals with the
				“soundscape” of the Mesnil Amelot 2 detention centre for illegal immigrants
				situated to the North of Paris just beside the Charles de Gaulle airport. It
				adjoins the initial older centre nearby and the two centres constitute the
				largest complex for detaining illegal immigrants in France, with 240 places for
				individuals and families. Approximately 350 aeroplanes pass closely above
				the centre over a 24 hours time span, creating intervals of very high sound
				levels that regularly drown out all other ambient sounds. A quadriphonic
				sound recording reconstructs this sonic environment. In parallel, Retention
				captures and diffuses a live transmission of communication between pilots
				and the Charles de Gaulle control tower. In the short intervals of silence
				(always implying sounds of some sort), the atmosphere seems suspended.
				This suspension is paradigmatic for the clash between the local and the
				global, between those who are trapped in a state of detention before being
				expulsed by the engines moving over their heads and those who circulate
				freely (nonetheless under surveillance) in our globalized society. Retention
				situates itself where “waiting zones” and processes of mobility meet, in a
				sonic space of constant fluctuations. </p>

			<h3>Biographical Note</h3>

			<p>Born in Berlin in 1980, she lives and works in Paris.
				Her research focuses on mechanisms of surveillance and mass media,
				theories of observation and attention and practices of counter-observation in
				contemporary art. Her doctoral thesis (University Paris 8/ Esthétique,
				Sciences et Technologies des Arts, dissertation defence November 2014) is
				entitled <em>(Counter-)observations, Relations of Observation and Surveillance in
				Contemporary Art, Literature and Cinema</em>. Anne Zeitz was responsible for
				organizing the project <em>Movement-Observation-Control</em> (2007/2008) for the
				Goethe-Institut Paris and collaborated on the exhibition and conference
				<em>Armed Response</em> (2008) at the Goethe-Institut Johannesburg. She is a former
				member of the Observatoire des nouveaux médias (Paris 8/Ensad) and of the
				research project <em>Média Médiums</em> (Paris 8/Beaux Arts de Cergy Pontoise,
				2013/2014). She is author of numerous photographic series, video
				installations and sound works dealing with issues relating to surveillance, the
				privatisation of security, the urban aesthetics of Euro-Disney and migration. </p>

			<p>Her most recent research concentrates on the work of the American artist
				Max Neuhaus with the publication of <em>De Max-Feed a Radio Net</em> (2014), part of
				the <em>Média Médiums</em> book series. </p>
