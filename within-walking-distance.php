            <h2>Within Walking Distance</h2>

			<p><b>The twenty-first century isn’t just a new era: it’s a different world. Over half the planet’s population lives in cities. Urban cultures demand and deserve special focus.</b></p>

			<p>The way we live, the way we work, the way we move, and the ways we understand ourselves and one another are influenced by this dense growth of cultures and populations.</p>

			<p>A multidisciplinary exhibition, <em>Within Walking Distance</em> examines urban life through the twin lens of photography and sociology.</p>

			<p>To live in a city is to explore what it means to be urban. We are not just spectators: we are inhabitants and participants.</p>

			<p>Combining traditional and contemporary photographic techniques with various experimental research methods, this exhibition opens up a discussion around representation and interpretation of the urban.</p>

			<p>Through panels, artist talks, and other public events, visitors can become part of the project; extend themes, offer views and insights, share knowledge.</p>
