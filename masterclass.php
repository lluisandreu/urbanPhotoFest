		<h1>Masterclass with Peter Marlow</h1>
		<h3>About the photographer</h3>
		<p>Urban Photo Fest is pleased to announce this year’s masterclass will be presented by
		international photographer Peter Marlow, former president of Magnum Photos. Peter’s work
		focuses on apparently incidental scenes that speak of social relations. His images have a
		compelling poetic quality and address notions of stasis, movement and change.</p>
		<h3>About the masterclass</h3>
		<p>Following an initial presentation of his work and discussion of related theoretical and
		technical issues, participants will introduce their images. The Masterclass will focus on how to
		build a visual story and participants will be given a working brief based on the themes
		discussed, and then work on producing a number of images to bring back to the group for
		feedback and critique. </p>
		<h3>What you will need</h3>
		<p>In order to participate you will need to submit a short description of the visual story that you
		intend to develop during the Masterclass along with a portfolio (up to 10 images)</p>
		<p>Due to the duration of the course participants are advised to produce and edit their work
		digitally. The images will need to be edited and put into a Power Point format for next day
		feedback. </p>
